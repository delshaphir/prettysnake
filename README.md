# Pretty Snake
An extremely simple Snake game written in Python by [del shaphir](http://www.github.com/delshaphir).

## Getting Started

**Mac OS & Linux**

1. Download `dist/snake`
2. Run it by:
   - Adding it as an application, or
   - Navigating to its directory and running it from the command line with `./snake`

**Note:** You may (probably) need to have the font Arial installed, I'm honestly not sure. Handling fonts with Pygame + PyInstaller kinda sucks.

## Built with
* Written in [Python](http://www.python.org)
* Using [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org)
* Compiled with [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org)
